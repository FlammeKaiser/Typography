    Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water
    Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after.
    Up Jack got and home did trot, as fast as he could caper
    went to bed to mend his head with vinegar and brown paper.

    Jill came in and she did grin to see his paper plaster 
    mother, vexâ€™d, did whip her next for causing Jack's disaster

    Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of milk, oh!
    jack was drest in his Sunday best, and Jill in her gown of silk, oh!
